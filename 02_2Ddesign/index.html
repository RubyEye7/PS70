<h3>Week 2: 2D Design & Cutting</h3>

<h4>Assignment 1: Make a Box</h4>

<p><strong>My Box:</strong></p>
<pre class="margin">
Making the box was an interesting process, starting back when we learned how to do the basic box form in class. After that time, 
I found it easy to learn by trial and error, and as a result, made a number of boxes that didn't get printed, but got modeled in different ways.
My fusion 360 files are currently littered with different iterations of boxes, but what I found out was that the practice is very important. I was able to set parameters
and take into account kerf, eventually figuring out how to get the box to fit together on its own for the most part. At first, figuring out the fingers
was a bit of a challenge, but eventually I was able to get it to work and can now replicate the process for future projects if needed. The more boxes
I made, the faster I got at making them. The 3D modeling was just the tip of the iceberg, and I found out that the laser cutter is actually more
of an obstacle. For some reason, I have been unable to have a full laser cutter session without setting at least a small fire or charring out a bit of cardboard.
I am meticulous with the dimensions, settings, and setup of the laser cutter, and I may just have bad luck. With my final box, however, I think that the fire is a lasting
symbol of my learning process. The corner may have burned out, as seen above, but it gives the box some character. I am happy with the final result, and will
consider making some protective sleeves/corners for the box in the future if I have time. In the meantime, it was really fun to design,
customize with a toothed access hole in the top. I am glad that I was able to make a finished box, and I am happy that fusion is becoming familiar.

<p><strong>Tutorial Learning Process:</strong></p>
<pre class="margin">
To me, the 3D modeling process was even more of a challenge, mostly because fusion 360 makes it easy to learn, but at the same time I don't feel as though
the 3D shaping is intuitive to me at first. Still, over the course of the past week, following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3qGQ2utl2A&t=38s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a number of tutorials</a>, following rabbit holes of fusion videos on youtube,
and just messing around with different models, measured meticulously or not, I figured it out. Now I believe that there is an intuitive way for me to think about it, and that relies
on heavy visualization and slow, deliberate work. The shortcuts are nice, but right now they trip me up. Going forward I am going to practice them more.
As I walk around, looking around me, and otherwise sit around, I now think of different objects in terms of the way that they could be constructed in fusion.
Sitting around was the way I figured out pieces of my designs that at first stumped me. Now I have a good understanding of the software, I know where to find more resources,
and I know how to deal with bottlenecks. Next for me is figuring out how to use the software for more motion simulations, such as the one that I believe I started with the 
assembly that comes later as a part of this week's assignment.

<p><strong>Cup Model:</strong></p>
<pre class="margin">
I would say that the cup was the first big tricky challenge I had to figure out, since the process of making the lego brick felt far more simple. It was square and circles, each simple,
as opposed to having tapered sides, embossed patterns, and more complex overall shape and delicate execution. When I sat down to make the cup, I did something that helped me learn fast. 
I set a 30 minute timer and just decided that whatever I was able to get done in that time was all I would do that evening. I had to figure it out myself, using as little outside resources as possible.
As you might be able to imagine, that was not exactly the best plan for getting a polished final project, but after that 30 minutes I delved deep into how to make designs using revolve, discovered emboss instead
of extrude, and refined the style. I decided to then look up the dimensions of one of the cups that I had in front of me in order to get better proportions. Immediately, the design was improved.
I played around with the material/appearance function (though decided to stick to the classic steel look rather than mess with a transparent 3D file). Eventually, the cup came together really nicely,
and I am pleased with the final result. Though it is still not perfect, it was a fantastic exploration into the creation of more complex shapes and models. Holding a cup in my hand, rotating it, and moving
my model at the same time was pivotal in helping me understand 3D modeling even more.

<p><strong>Assembly Creation:</strong></p>
<pre class="margin">
The assembly creation was the most fun challenge as a part of this week's assignment. When deciding what to make for this part of the week, I wanted to look at something that, in theory, seems simple,
but actually could be something that I can continue to practice on when the week is over as I continue to learn more about how motion and joints work. What I have constructed for my
assembly is a (presently) inert airpods case, with a cable port that I can plug another component, a cable, into. While each one in and of itself is simple, and the interaction is not threaded or curving in motion, 
I wanted to make sure that I captured the most simple form first, and I was proud of what I was able to get out of it doing a motion study on the assembly. In order to keep the dimensions of each component very consistent,
I made sure to do my research on the exact size of the ports, dimensions, and other forms of the components, using both the internet and some calipers to refine the relationship between the model and reality. These parameters were then standardized so that the fit of each piece to one another would be perfect, yet detailed.
Once I finished the cable, I wanted to make sure that there was some sort of visual differentiator. In this case, I used the white ABS plastic material appearance, so that the cord looks
like a real cord plugging into the port. The final motion simulation was a bit of a tougher thing for me to understand and figure out, mostly because I had an initial lack of understanding about 
the fact that 'joint' seems to be the umbrella term for the interactions between the different pieces. While I may have this wrong, I am open to finding out more about the motion
simulation next week as we move into the kinetic sculpture assignment. Understanding how components move and interact with one another is really important.
During one of my times in the lab outside of class this past week, I was talking to one of the TFs and he suggested that playing around with things physically is a good way to understand
how fusion might be able to model things in a more intuitive way. I am glad that I was able to think about things after this conversation more physically, imagining them in my head or rotating my hands
to represent different pieces, and, in this case, plugging in a cord to the object itself to get a feel how the pieces fit and look together. I think that it would be interesting to continue to add more components and complexity to the assembly, such as by allowing the airpods case to open.
For now, I am happy with the current final result and the amount that I was able to learn from it. Fusion 360 will surely only get easier. The videos and photos that I have attached are a representation of the transition from the
physical to the digital, and I am glad now that I am able to get even a preliminary sense of how that transition works. I am excited to continue to explore how to turn things like
concept drawings into 3D models and then into physical objects.
