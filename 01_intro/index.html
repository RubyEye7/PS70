<h3>Week 1: Final Project Proposal</h3>

<p class = "margin"></p>
Here are at most 3 ideas for my final project
<p class = "margin"></p>

<h4>Idea 1 : Computer Vision Speaker</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

I want to create a speaker that can be controlled by computer vision. In order to turn it on or off, I will use a <br>
camera to detect the user's hand and use that hand gesture. There will be servos (or perhaps a small robot) that walks <br>
along the top of the speaker to punch the buttons according to the directions.

<h4>Idea 2: Automatic CD Player and Storage</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

I want to create a CD storage and playing system that will swap, and play, the CDs based on the user's requests. <br>
This system should operate like a minature jukebox, with an arm that swaps and stores the CDs in a rotating carousel. <br>
Users should be able to select the CD they want to play by pressing a button on the front of the system. <br>
I want to come up with a token system that allows the user to "pay" for the music they want to listen to.

<h4>Idea 3: Wall Clock</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

I want to create a wall clock that will display the current time. The concept is that the middle of the clock will be <br>
the moon, with a phase indicator made out of LEDS that will change as the moon goes through its phases. The rings of the clock
will be moving lights or other symboles that will represent seconds minutes and hours. Ideally, the clock will be made out of machined <br>
metal parts.
